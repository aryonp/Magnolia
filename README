<h2>Magnolia</h2>

Magnolia is a PHP based web framework that I developed 5 years ago to help me finished my Thesis ;-)

At first it was only a library that used to develop an integrated web-based online IT inventory and request system that conforms ITILv2.

Its basic functionalities goes to;
- User Request -> Manager Approval -> IT Admin
- IT Request for Approval -> Director's Approval
- Purchase Order
- Vendor Evaluation
- Inventory
- Report: Inventory depreciation, PO Expenses, Summary off all data inputted to the system
- Security: Specific menu opens only to certain user groups, log history, 7 last transactions, etc

On its way to expand, Magnolia start its popularity as a base library for several system in different business process; Logistic, Credit Facility, Medical, and Goverment Management System.

Developer can expand its functionality by writing a new library class or merge Magnolia with some plugins such as JQuery, Twitter Bootstrap, PHPLot, etc.

Hopefully, developers/users that want to share their knowledge and extending their creativity on the way of programming can starts from here ;-)

To start using Magnolia immediately, <br/>
- Simply copy all files to your web root folder, <br/>
- Change all the basic settings located on init.php <br/>
- Import the magnolia.sql to the MySQL Server <br/>

Minimum requirements: LAMP or WAMP
